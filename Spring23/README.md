P4 language tutorials:

Please note that you need BMV2 to run a software version of a programmable switch and you
need p4c as well, to compile your p4 codes on this switch. You can find both here:

  [bmv2](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model) and
  [p4c](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c). 

  Also, you need to install mininet on your machine to be able to create virtual hosts and virtual switches. Mininet can be found here:
